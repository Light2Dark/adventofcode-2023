## Learnings with GoLang
1. Concurrency with GoRoutines and mutexes. Only learnt about race conditions in theory (OS classes) but seeing it in practice is interesting and the solutions, elegant. AoC problems shouldn't be bruteforced, but I used it as a chance to learn about concurrency in Go.

2. Pointers in Go. Variables having pointers, memory addresses and dereferencing/indirection is very new coming from a Python world. I am too spoiled. But learning about it here made me appreciate the language more.
